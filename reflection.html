        A responsive web design is designing of a web application taking into account dynamic changes in the size,
        orientation, and devices. These parameters may change while the user is using the application. For example, a
        user may be using the application full screen on a desktop, but then decides to make the window smaller. If that
        happens, the developer should take into account how the application should look at that point to make sure it is
        still readable. Usually, dynamic web design can be accomplished by using break points in CSS. We can define the
        break points with parameters such as maximum and minimum screen sizes, etc. Then, the developer can make the
        application presentable to end-users by doing CSS for each case in a clear manner. This way, the web application
        can now be presented on small devices such as smartphones and desktops, etc. For examples, on a large enough
        window, I may want to display a group of elements horizontally, but on smaller one, I may decide to align them
        vertically.
        <br />
        Responsive web designs relate to web technologies because it is obviously relevant in a way that web
        applications should be presented in a way that it can handle the dynamic changes in parameters such as sizes of
        the windows, thus making it easier for the user to use. Again, for now, I can think of developing application
        with responsive design in CSS, and as I do more projects, there may be times I need to use javascript to handle
        the way web application is presented. For example, on a large enough screen, I would assume that the user will
        have the mouse, so I could add on hover behaviors on elements such as change in color on hover, but on smaller
        one, I could disable that. Another example is, I may want to add some animations to the application for
        presentation on large enough screen using javascript, but on smaller one, I could just disable it and put an
        image instead.
        <br />
        I learned a lot about building web applications for different devices through my own research. Specifically for
        different devices, I learned about using break points in CSS for presentation. I did not get to do a lot of
        those in this course, but I can see myself using those a lot in the future. One thing I discovered on my own
        research that I like is Google Chrome comes with built in tool called “Toogle device toolbar”. This allows me to
        quickly overview how my application would like on mobile devices, and furthermore, how user can use it as it can
        simulate the touch functions. I can see myself using this a lot in the future. I learned throughout the course
        how friendly Google Chrome is designed for developers. Another remarkable thing I learned is regex. I watched
        some youtube tutorials on how to do basic regex for form validation.
        <br />
        Overall, my learning experience in this course is excellent in my opinion. I have learned a lot about CSS. I
        have learned a little bit about CSS in high school, but it was very brief and I had to rely a lot on flex box
        tool to make my life easier. After taking this course, CSS makes a lot more sense to me now. I have also learned
        to manipulate the DOM using javascript. Even though most of the jobs in industry will probably use frameworks
        like JQuery, React, etc. understanding vanilla javascript helps me to learn advanced technologies with solid
        foundation knowledge. In high school, I only learned a little bit about static HTML and CSS, but this course
        helps me to learn how to intergrate javascript into web technology to do basic functions such as switching the
        page, validating the form, etc. I have learned a lot in this course, and I am more confident about building a
        web application and I feel that I am more ready for the developer job.
